An Irisian and [[The Toshkan Empire|Toshkan]] ship collided. There was confusion over who was at fault and a conflict occurred. There was one loss on the Irisian side and six on the Toshkan side. This was a serious embarrassment for the Toshkan Empire. 

[[Nystar/Places/Continents/Shannalotte/The Kingdom of Caderousse/Osiris]]'s King's second fianc√© was on the Irisian ship. [[Fafnir]] pledged to support the Osirians. Lord Marshall Praxis spent some time firing near the border of Fafnir. 

Someone shot the Queen of the Toshkan Empire, [[Jessamine Hypatia]], in her bed but she survived the attack. It hasn't been declared who committed the violence. (I suspect the Underground given their awareness of upcoming unrest and Benecio being at an underground meeting and telling her that the Queen was shot)
