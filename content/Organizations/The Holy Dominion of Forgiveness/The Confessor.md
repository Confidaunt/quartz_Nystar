The role of the Confessor is the role of a Sin Eater. One of the most sacred arts in the world, to receive the sins of others, to allow their sin to taint your soul, is what it means to be a Confessor. Confessors hold the most important position within the Children of Mercy, and it is through them that all shall follow, and Confessors are protected by the Iron Shepherds and the Harvesters of Forgiveness. But a Confessor is not immune to the sins of the world, and when the Confessor begins to overflow with sin, that is when the Harvest is made.

The Harvest is ritual in which the Confessor is sacrificed. The next confessor will bear witness, and will learn of the sins that the Confessor has heard throughout their time. When this recanting is completed, the former Confessor will be snared into a reality marble. A pocket dimension wherein time and space do not obey the same laws of physics as our own. Their suffering will be witnessed by all in attendance, but will not be intervened with at all. The sins the Confessor heard will be given material form within the marble, and they will ensure that the Confessor suffers to full anguish and agony that they received from all those confessed. All violations, torture, humiliations and maiming will be done onto the Confessor, whom will be unable to die until every sin is harvested. The Reality Marble will then dissolve, melting down the Confessor, shattering their connection to the Loom of the world and harvesting their very soul. The void of the soul that follows will give birth to another of the Nameless Gods.

While the Loom of the world is full of threads that connects all living things to their True name, through the Veil, the magical barrier that separates the afterlife with the planet. Long ago, there was an attempt to burn the loom. The Burning failed, but those whom lit themselves ablaze to burn it all down, found their threads drifting into the dark void between the Veil and the Planet, into the Unknowable Labyrinth of the Void, those tattered threads weaving themselves into the Nameless Gods. Deep in the labyrinth, is where Maodokanna sits upon the Throne of Want, and through the history of sin, will the path toward him be made clear, so he may shatter the Veil, and light the Loom ablaze one more, so that all may fall into the darkness of the Void, and receive the Ultimate Mercy of everlasting suffering.

**The Heart and Flame**
The Confessor is promoted by the Church as the focus of a cult of personality. The Confessor is the center of comfort and someone to be depended on. Love letters, stalkers, proclamation of devotion is common. Being in their presence is considered a blessing. There are statues and paintings of the Confessor throughout the Dominion. 

**The Confessor and the Church:**
Certain members of the church and Confessor's entourage, are quite aware of the degree of exaggeration needed in order to keep things stable and moving towards the Ultimate Mercy. There is blind loyalty within the faith, but there are also the pragmatic and self aware types.

There are several ways to have time made to see the Confessor, acts of service to the church, donations, and favors. Those can all be used to perhaps gain an audience with the Confessor, but Confessions only happen on the three days of the Harvest Moon.

Daily Life
The Confessor's position could be called suffocating. They are ensconced in layers of protection to ensure that they are safe. The word no is not one that the Confessor hears often, but there are things that are made difficult, or that the entourage discourages. Plans may be set up, but then something goes wrong, or something urgent comes up that needs to be attended to.
