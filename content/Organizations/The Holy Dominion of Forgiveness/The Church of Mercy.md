The Holy Dominion of of Forgiveness is the home of the Children of Mercy. They are also known as Children of the Black Towers or Maodokhans. Itzal is what outsiders call the country. It is a theocratic city state.

Devout followers of Maodokanna, the Children of Mercy, have helped bring Umbassa back into a shade of its former glory, long forgotten. The ebony towersÂ of Forgiveness that pierce the thick mist rising high and above. They wish for nothing but the end of suffering for all. And wish to fulfill that with everything in their power. They take in all sinners, are criminals, all outcasts. May the hopeless and the wretched find comfort, for the Children of Mercy shall eat your sin away, and allow you to feel pure. Blood magic, profane displays, and sacrilegious rituals are all rumored, but have rarely been confirmed, but never denied by the Children of Mercy. There is no shame in their land of Umbassa, no bigotry, no hatred. There is only acceptance, of your impure soul.

**Religion**
The Loom of the world is full of threads that connects all living things to their True name, through the Veil, the magical barrier that separates the afterlife with the planet. Long ago, there was an attempt to burn the loom. The Burning failed, but those whom lit themselves ablaze to burn it all down, found their threads drifting into the dark void between the Veil and the Planet, into the Unknowable Labyrinth of the Void, those tattered threads weaving themselves into the Nameless Gods. Deep in the labyrinth, is where Maodokanna sits upon the Throne of Want, and through the history of sin, will the path toward him be made clear, so he may shatter the Veil, and light the Loom ablaze one more, so that all may fall into the darkness of the Void, and receive the Ultimate Mercy of everlasting suffering.

Should one of the faithful die without final confession, they are raised from the dead as a zombie or revenant. If there is no final confession then there is only eternal suffering. To the most faithful, eternal suffering is a blessing. 

There are two gods that are considered open enemies of Maodokanna, [[Nystar]] and [[Pandora]]. Pandora's followers have actively assisted in the church's downfall in centuries past. She is the creator of the Veil that Maodokanna wants to tear down. Dragons and those that would kill the Confessor are considered beyond the Mercy that the Dominion provides. Celestials have an interesting relationship with the church and are coveted by the Church.

The Philosopher's Stone is an important component of completing the labyrinth. It's currently held by [[Enrico Caruso Junior]].

**Confessors**
The role of [[The Confessor]] is the role of a Sin Eater. One of the most sacred arts in the world, to receive the sins of others. Confessors are protected by the Iron Shepherds and the Harvesters of Forgiveness. But a Confessor is not immune to the sins of the world, and when the Confessor begins to overflow with sin, that is when the Harvest is made.

**[[The Tenets of Mercy]]**
Everything that we do is sinful. Sin is the most beautiful thing there is. There is only one god, and their name is Maodokanna. There is only one language in the world, and that language is pain.
Pain is the great unifier. 

**Iron Shepherds**
A force of guardians and hunters that server the Church of Mercy in whatever capacity needed. They protect the Confessor and other important figures in the church like Persephone.

There is no doubt in their conviction. No failure in their resolve. They aren't along for the ride. They are fully committed. They are the Terminator. Unafraid of death, unafraid of pain, unable to feel fear. They have no cause or concern for any law, in any place, regardless of how outmatched they are. They're also incredibly skilled infiltrators. [[The Iron Shepards|Known Members]]

**Harvesters of Forgiveness**

**Culture**
Symbols of the church include a crowns of thorns, and a sword or scythe being pierced through the back of someone, much like this portrait, or images of people on fire.

Dragonkin aren't tolerated in the Dominion. 

**History**
**Geography**
**Demographics**
**Economy**
The lands of the Dominion are fruitful. Wheat, corn, and a number of squash are main exports of the Dominion. People are also sold as slaves.

**Education**
**Law**
Laws in the Dominion are less Laws and more a code of conduct. It's also prone to change depending on the interests and projects of the Confessor. Peace is meant to be kept in the day to day functioning of the country. Anything threatening the stability or sanctity of the Dominion or any threat toward the Ultimate Mercy isn't tolerated. The Confessor can decide what the terms of forgiveness looks like in a more granular manner should they choose to. Often times, they only concern themselves with the forgiveness and punishment of what interests them and hands the less concerns onto their entourage. Suffering is forgiveness.

Those who are repeat offenders are given lowered priority for confession. The church is very aware that some people can get attached to the Confessor and will step in to prevent that.
