Also known as Finis animae.

The rites themselves involve twisting and contorting the persons soul and unravelling it entirely. And it is also nothing short of the most amount of agony somebody can possibly be put through, just without the escape of death because its happening as the last thing that the person ever knows.

A person put down by one of [[The Iron Shepards]] with the proper rites may in fact go down to the Void, but their life, their sins, are wasted. Wasted resource that could have been used to map out more of the labyrinth, could have been used to further [[The Confessor]]'s' progression. Could have been used to make new [[Harvester of Sin]]. Instead, just absolutely wasted, which is why Shepherds won't do it out of hand. Unless they are trying to send a message. But Only the Confessor can map out the labyrinth.
