The Platinum Dragons are the most powerful adventuring guild since [[The Looking Glass Ravens]]. After the [[Prelude to the War of the Diamond Straits]], it was mentioned that they were being recalled. 

Our guild stumbled into a fight under [[Mt. Megadeath]] between them and an unknown metal dragon lady. Several members were dead. The Legendseekers assisted by interrupting a ritual to cast 'Meteor' and fleeing on an armed bomb train headed towards [[Megido]].
