A team of two, [[Lars Beaumont]] and [[Sixer]]. Seems like a paladin and rogue as [[The Legendseekers]] have seen Lars smite and Sixer move very quickly. 

[[Juliet Amrankur LeBeaux]] met them in the [[Tiny Train Bar]]. [[Griff Whiteflower]] knows Lars from his childhood. Everyone was properly introduced during the Annual Beast Hunt.
