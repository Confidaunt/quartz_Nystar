A team of three: [[Whistler]], [[Cooke]], and [[Hogar]]. They were encountered in the sewers while [[The Legendseekers]] were trying to find our way back up to the surface after disabling the bomb train. Whistler's kid sister, [[Sofina]], tagged along into the sewers and was injured. 

[[Kirby]] showed them the way to the Night Market.

[[Kalos]] assisted with the poisoning and the weresharkism that Whistler and Cooke suffered from respectively.
