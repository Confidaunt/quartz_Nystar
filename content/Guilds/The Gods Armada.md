The seventh guild that [[Darrill Mercuria]] mentored. She was their mentor for an unknown period. 4 Adventurers. During their rank 2 evaluation, they were assigned a job to do security for a weapons transport. Improper storage methods from the Caderoussian Kingdom led to them being exposed to unstable and illegal chemical weapons within the cargo ship. Quarantined within the ship itself. Mercury was temporarily arrested when she violated military protocol to attempt to board the ship. Due to her considerable contributions to the Archives, this criminal charge, and her previous criminal record and prisoner of the empire status were revoked in recognition of her work as part of the Archives.
