The ninth guild that [[Darrill Mercuria]] mentored. She was their mentor for an unknown period. The team had two of her children on it, [[Charlie]] and [[Angel]]. 

The guild was assumed death after attempting a mission to retrieve [[Persephone]] from the [[The Holy Dominion of Forgiveness]]. 

The fate of the guild was classified per request of the loved ones. All died about 4 months prior to game start.
