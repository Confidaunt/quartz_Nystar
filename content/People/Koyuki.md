Summary: She was brought back from Zhire after the conflict there by Mercury. She views Mercury as a mother. She's an Eildon summoner. She's very prone to being downed in combat because she doesn't appreciate the importance of distance from opponents. She's a warlock and seems to be water themed. She reacted very strongly to her mind being read by Cerberus. She is flighty and doesn't seem to be an experienced adventurer. She is nice and cares about Mercury.  

Appearance: Her appearance matches that of the Goddess Koyuki. Darrill wasn't a creative namer.
