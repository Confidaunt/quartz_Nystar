She was brought back by [[Darrill Mercuria|Mercury]] from [[Zhire]] after the [[The Zhire Incident]]. She views Mercury as a mother. She's an Eildon summoner. She's very prone to being downed in combat because she doesn't appreciate the importance of distance from opponents. She's a warlock and seems to be water themed. She reacted very strongly to her mind being read by [[Cerberus]] during [[The Attack on the Slums]]. She is flighty and doesn't seem to be an experienced adventurer. She is nice and cares about Mercury.  

Her appearance matches that of the Goddess [[Divinity/Gods/Koyuki|Koyuki]]. Darrill wasn't a creative namer.
