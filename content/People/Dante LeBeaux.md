[[Juliet Amrankur LeBeaux|Juliet]]'s brother. Is dating or married to [[Loomis]]. He can cast shatter. He likes his sister enough to tell Loomis, "Loomis, don't."

He's dimensioned doored away by [[Francis]]. 

He, Francis and Loomis are in a conspiracy to save the Chancellor. He's been away for over a year. 

During [[The Attack on the Slums]], he stood too close to [[Griff Whiteflower]] and frightening [[Lars Beaumont]] who almost one shot him. Juliet's reaction tipped off [[Victor Von Rudamente|Victor]] who spent his final spell slot to transmute Dante into a big ol demon. Loomis was emotionally crushed at the scene. Fortunately, Lars/Griff figured out that Dante was still in the demon and they just cut him out. 

During his recovery post slorping, he banished Juliet and told [[Cerberus]] "The Weave, we can protect it" Loomis looked horrified. Then Cerberus, Loomis and Dante walked through the firey portal that Cerberus summoned.
