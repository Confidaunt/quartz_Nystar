Summary:
Juliet's brother. Is dating or married to Loomis. He can cast shatter. He likes his sister enough to tell Loomis, "Loomis, don't."

He's dimensioned doored away by Francis. 

He, Francis and Loomis are in a conspiracy to save the Chancellor. He's been away for over a year. 

During Victor's last stand, he stood too close to Griff and frightening Lars who almost one shot him. Juliet's reaction tipped off Victor who spent his final spell slot to transmute Dante into a big ol demon. Loomis was emotionally crushed at the scene. Fortunately, Lars/Griff figured out that Dante was still in the demon and they just cut him out. 

During his recovery post slorping, he banished Juliet and told Cerberus "The Weave, we can protect it" Loomis looked horrified. Then Cerberus, Loomis and Dante walked through the firey portal that Cerberus summoned.
