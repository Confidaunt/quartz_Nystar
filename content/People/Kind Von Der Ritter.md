Summary:
Kind Von Der Ritter, Lord Kaiser, The Eighth Pillar. The Commander in Chief for the Toshkan Empire. From the air to the land to the seas they command the vast armada without ever a thought of disloyalty to the Sovereign. To them, those whom question the Sovereign within the Empire are guilty of treason, and those outside of it who do the same are making a declaration of war.
