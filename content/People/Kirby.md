Summary:
A blue haired elvish man. His nickname is 'Pink'. He encountered the party as he and Juilet were listening in on a conversation between Francis and Leon. Kirby was on his way back after being out of the city for a while on 'business'. He escorted the party through the Night Markets and to Kalos who assisted in fixing the poisoning/weresharking of the adventuring group that the Legendseekers found in the sewers. He also escorted that group out of the night market. 

The Legendseekers next met him at the Orphan's Theatre. He reported that the curtains to the Night Market were disabled. He thought this was very unusual. It's an open secret now to the Legendseekers that he's in the Thieves Guild. He was working for the leader of the Thieves Guild, The Shadow, trying to discover who was broken out of a prison in the Jade Sea. The enormous storm was a cover for the escape. 

He knows of Loomis and says that they help the Shadow keep track of what's going on in Meggido.

He has some relation to Koyuki-the-girl.
