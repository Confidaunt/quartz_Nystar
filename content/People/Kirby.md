A blue haired elvish man. His nickname is 'Pink'. He encountered the party as he and [[Juliet Amrankur LeBeaux|Juilet]] were listening in on a conversation between [[Francis]] and [[Leon]]. Kirby was on his way back after being out of the city for a while on 'business'. He escorted the party through [[The Night Market]] and to [Kalos] who assisted in fixing the poisoning/weresharking of the adventuring group that the Legendseekers found in the sewers. He also escorted that group out of the night market. 

The Legendseekers next met him at [[The Orphan's Theatre]]. He reported that the curtains to the Night Market were disabled. He thought this was very unusual. It's an open secret now to the Legendseekers that he's in [[The Thieves Guild]]. He was working for the leader of the Thieves Guild, [[The Shadow]], trying to discover who was broken out of a prison in the [[Jade Sea]]. The enormous storm was a cover for the escape. 

He knows of [[Loomis]] and says that they help the Shadow keep track of what's going on in Meggido.

He has some relation to [[Koyuki]]-the-girl.
