Sway has a jinx on her. It's in regards to Koyuki's name. It's unclear why it was placed. Juliet is the one who knew what a hex was. 

“This spineless biased child will fail to bring the crisis she’s divining. I’m not impressed with your lifeless mind or the mindless life you’re miming! And NO. You can’t call Darill and pass the buck the mommy so she can handle this! They all treat you with love, I know it must make you feel so ill. Destined to end up like your pretty little girlfriend, nothing more than roadkill. You’re so soulless you perfectly replicate the  pictures Darril pins on her walls! An anxious empty little bitch that ripped her soul with what she caused. Where’s the light of your life? You’re already living in hell. I couldn’t do it better, I’m out of a job, pray tell! Burning the loom won’t make your life painless, even in the Void you’ll stay obsessed and desperate. Your mind is your own labyrinth and you’ll never find the exit." ~ Cerberus

Named people Sway has killed/had the final hit on: [[Chester]] [[Esmerelda]] [[Cthon]] [[Jellybones]]
