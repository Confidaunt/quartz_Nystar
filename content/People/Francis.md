Summary:
[[Kirby]] 'Pink' and Juliet were listening in on a conversation between Francis and Leon:

"Don't care what Flynn says, once Jupiter's back, our heads will roll. We need to get the kid out. Turtleduck is a last resort if Thorne doesn't hold up their end of the bargain, we'll take the other. You know how they work. ...Four's a crowd"

"Thorne's dad jumped the gun. Get every magictech downside. Clear out down below. Don't leave things unturned. "

Juliet attacked a carriage that Francis, [[Dante LeBeaux]], and [[Loomis]] were in. There was a scuffle in which Francis dimension doored out Dante.
