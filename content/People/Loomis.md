Summary:
A changeling that used the form of Thorn. They were only revealed when Juliet punched the carriage that they, Dante, Juliet's brother, and Francis were in to 'Say hi'. They are in a relationship with Dante. Very nosy about the group. Came from the same place as Peter. Complained that the 'Twink' Benecio was always fucking with their plans.

They have a established Inquisitor persona. They claim they are trying to save the Chancellor. They claim that Thorn wants to blow up the city. They were very coy about Victor Rudamente hating his brother Benecio.

They seem to be truthful in what they've told the guild so far, ie Victor hates his brother and Thorne is skilled with bombs.
