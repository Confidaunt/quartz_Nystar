A goliath with a porn mustache. He sells Mexican and Japanese food. Friendly. He'd previously made contact with Juliet. Son of [[Abuela]].

He is seen by [[Juliet Amrankur LeBeaux|Juliet]] helping [[Darrill Mercuria|Darrill]] get dressed the day of her departure to [[Yggdrasil]]. Darrill tells Juliet that GG is her best friend and that he is going to introduce them to the thieves guild while she's away. 

During the attack on the slums, he was sheltering with his mother and others in the Orphan Theatre. He said that Victor and Mercury talked sometime and fought sometimes. GG hadn't seen Victor in years.
