He was the leader of the team, [[Cthon's Vambrace]], that tried to butt into the [[The Legendseekers]]'s first mission, [[Deliver Airship Fuel]]. They managed to pierce the casing of the highly volatile fuel. Cthon briefly had the fuel while [[Juliet Amrankur LeBeaux|Juliet]] yelled about it being a bomb. He threw it at her and yelled it was a bomb. Sway and Malakai stopped him from confusing the situation further.
