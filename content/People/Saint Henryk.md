Henryk was the founder of the first church of mercy, doing so before he was even thirteen years old. And through his teachings he led the first followers into the first steps of cleansing themselves of true sin. With his loyal sentinel Malakai at his side, they quite nearly succeeded in bringing Maodokonna into the world, to bless the world with the ultimate mercy. But it was not meant to be, and for their great platitudes they were killed.
