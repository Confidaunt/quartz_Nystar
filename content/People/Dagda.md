The King and father of [[Bazett Sc√°thach Dagda]]. [[Benecio Plutok Rudamente]] claimed that he was a member of [[The Knights of the Round Table]] known as [[Morganna]]. Benecio further claimed that the Round Table killed him because Benecio was getting too close to discovering him. 

[[Sir Peter Chamberlin Cottontail]] noted that King Dagda was acting irrationally near the end of his life. 

[[Nystar/People/Cerberus|Cerberus]] mentioned that she "Hopes they find the culprit soon."
