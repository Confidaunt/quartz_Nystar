Benecio's brother who really doesn't like him. Once Sway's main suspect for who is killing Mercury's teams. He likely has some kind of monitoring on Benecio's Tower as it was bombed after the reality pearl protecting it was triggered.

He was discovered by finding a job posting that was removed shortly after it was posted. The Sewer Kids were the ones to provide the posting.

After being called Benecio and an evil wizard by Sway, he revealed that all of the Looking Glass Ravens all died and he brought them back with heretical magics. Victor was branded(literally) a heretic and served time in prison. The Inquisition was summoned by Victor's escape. He feels that Benecio killed their mother and the ravens through his creation of the Mist.  The LGR pushed themselves so hard in the Zhire that they burned themselves out of the loom. He warns that if we keep playing with Benecio, well all die. We should just run away. He says that he experimented on Thorne and she is planning on destroying the city. He knows where the chimera are coming from. 

He says, "A smart bomb maker makes two bombs"

Sway returned Victor's letter to his mother. She attempted to have a conversation with him that went poorly. He said that Persephone killed Charlie and Angel. He said that Sway gave her a purpose and told her where to find the people that helped kill her kids. He breaks her nose and storms off. 

He is sleeping when he's confronted by Lars and Griff who ask him if it's possible the arcstone is involved. There's chatter back and forth and Victor puts forth the idea of a teleportation circle powered by all the casters in the slums to teleport them somewhere safe. 

Sway goes back for seconds and confirms that Oksana Cornetto is untouched by and unknown to Victor. Victor is then a little bitch about getting the door shut on him.

"How's this for petty family drama?"
