A red cloaked figure with webbed hands. He has some sort of illusionary and portal powers.

He also summoned a giant death toad that the party fought. After it was defeated, the party went up some stairs and Morgan was spooked. Juliet sensed magic, realized the floor wasn't real and the party fell into a kind of nether space that lead further into Mount Megadeath.

Maria revealed that this was Victor Rudamente.
