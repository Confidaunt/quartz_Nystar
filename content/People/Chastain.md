Summary:
What appeared to be a very normal and competent Inquisitor is instead a submissive gambling addict with an exhibition fetish married to [[Oksandra Cornetto]], owner and Adjudicator of the Golden Lounge.

Chastain had let herself in and made/purchase a lovely meal. She offered Morgan, whom was disguised as a servant, a position as her squire. The rest of the party arrived shortly after and she was politely told to leave. She politely told them that she wouldn't and she had a few questions. She was then possessed by Sway's patron and said "Tenpenny, Entertainment District."

Only Griff stayed behind as Juliet, Morgan, and Peter ran off to rescue Sway. Chastain didn't remember any of what happened while she was possessed and also was suffering a serious concussion. 

Griff told her she'd been possessed by a Tenpenny who was in the Entertainment District. Chastain secretly held a beyond serious gambling addiction and took Griff to The Golden Lounge, a premier gambling house in the Entertainment District. 


Appearance: 

An Albino Elf. She was first encountered by the party at the Royal Flush when they emerged from the sewer's after Escobar's Train.


First Met: 
She had prepared a meal in the Royal Flush and greeted all the Legendseekers except for Sway who was being held by [[Oksandra Cornetto]] after [[Tenpenny]] failed to sell Sway as a new wife to Cornetto. One of Sway's passengers possessed Chastain and said, "Entertainment District, Tenpenny." Chastain sustained a concussion and didn't recall being possessed.

Last Met: 
She was on the gambling table with a golden collar on, her leash being held by [[Oksandra Cornetto]].
