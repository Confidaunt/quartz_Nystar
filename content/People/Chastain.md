She's an albino elf. What appeared to be a very normal and competent Inquisitor is instead a submissive gambling addict with an exhibition fetish married to [[Oksandra Cornetto]], owner and Adjudicator of [[The Golden Lounge]].

She had prepared a meal in the Royal Flush and greeted all the Legendseekers except for Sway who was being held by [[Oksandra Cornetto]] after [[Tenpenny]] failed to sell Sway as a new wife to Cornetto. One of Sway's passengers possessed Chastain and said, "Entertainment District, Tenpenny." Chastain sustained a concussion and didn't recall being possessed.

She was last seen on the gambling table with a golden collar on, her leash being held by [[Oksandra Cornetto]].
