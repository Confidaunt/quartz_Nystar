A dimetrodon man that was running the Marauders in the area around [[Megido]]. He was first encountered after the party fell into a portal in [[Mt. Megadeath]]. He was found to be torturing [[Thorn]] about a lost shipment. [[Juliet Amrankur LeBeaux|Juliet]] interrupted and fought him. She was used as a weapon by Escobar in attacking others and knocked unconscious. [[Morgan]] stole several magical items, including one that kept him in human shape. Sway caught him with a Suggestion to "Guide and Guard" herself and her companions. Escobar lit up some stone in the floor and turned it into an elevator. 

Juliet was later confounded into hostilities against Escobar and Sway had to 'break up with' her to keep the suggestion from breaking. Once the elevator reached the ground floor, most of the party booked it out of the elevator into the middle of another fight. 

[[The Platinum Dragons]] were fighting a single woman wearing silverish dragon armor with mechanical movements. Sway called for Escobar "Help! I feel that I am in danger!" 

One of the Platinum Dragons, a fire genasi, spoke with the group briefly about the dragon armored woman casting the spell meteor with a number of floating stone tablets. Sway and company hitched a ride on Escobar to interrupt the tablets. The dragon armored woman sped over to attack the party. After a couple of back and forths, Escobar swatted her back to the Platinum Dragons and the ritual was stopped. Cronos popped up and dispelled the Suggestion that Sway had on Escobar. 

Escobar said that he was going to kill us, but for now, the only way out was to get a lift with him. Only Morgan took him up on it. Morgan reverse pickpocketed the 'shape of human' anklet onto his dick and Escobar went splat from the 300ft drop.

The rest of the group followed down the hole and found Escobar's bomb train started. 

He is both Esmerelda's and Thorne's father. [[Victor Von Rudamente]] revealed that he experimented on Escobar and the empire bought Thorn for him to experiment on.
