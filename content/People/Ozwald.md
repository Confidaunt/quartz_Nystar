He's bald and favors all white as a color palette.

Previously the focus of Sway's anxieties. Needs to mind his manners. Works for the moonlight archive as an Archivist(Guild Rep). He was assigned [[Cthon's Vambrace]] and [[The Once and Future Kings]]. Sway suspects him of interference with our first official mission. 

He's considered nice by [[Petunia Leopard|Petunia]] and [[Darrill Mercuria|Mecury]]. He and Petunia once dated. 

Sway sent Malakai to find him in his home to ask for help. She asked Lars and Petunia for information that she wouldn't know to prove that the request is legitimate. Lars paid off your dad's debt. Likes the smells of cherry blossoms.
