Summary:
She's a force of nature that isn't good at taking no for an answer. She is an older sister and it shows. She and Sway often butt heads, but it's a difference in their nature rather than a fundamental disagreement, so far.

She came to the big city to earn money to send back to her family. Her brother Dante joined the army to do the same.

She has a funny habit of stumbling into the plot accidentally. 

She knows swamp magic and about hexes.

Juliet is given the message coin by Griff as he's concentrating on Victor's magic circle. It's a message from Marigold.

"You may have noticed that you can't get into the slums. We believe that an escaped prisoner is within. They are very dangerous. They are in slums."

She asks, "Is it Victor Rudemnte?" 

"We think he's in the slums, that's why they are locked down. Ask for Francis, he's organizing the Strike Team. For Victor, material components are people. "

Juliet then punches really really hard.



 “And if it isn’t the firebrand. Old and bitter enough about accepting all the responsibility onto your shoulders of your own free will yet still so young and proud that you’ll never ask for help with the burden. Like smoke in the wind, it’s left you that feeling guilty about something and an apology aren’t the same thing. Desperate to blind yourself to all the burn marks all those around you bare, yet even more desperate to ignore the truth that a bottled up flame can only ever burn itself out. Pity." ~ Cerberus

Appearance: A tanned and toned fire genasi.
