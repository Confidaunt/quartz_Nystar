Summary:
She's a force of nature that isn't good at taking no for an answer. She is an older sister and it shows. She and Sway often butt heads, but it's a difference in their nature rather than a fundamental disagreement, so far.

She came to the big city to earn money to send back to her family. Her brother Dante joined the army to do the same.

She has a funny habit of stumbling into the plot accidentally. 

She knows swamp magic and about hexes.

Appearance: A tanned and toned fire genasi.
