Summary:
The Legendseekers and the sewer team that they rescued were escorted by [[The Sewer Kids|Kirby]] to Kalos's tent in the Nightmarket. He is a high fox man in stilettos. He was sleeping on the pillowed floor in robes. The Legendseekers thrilled him generally. He seemed especially fond of Morgan. He cured the poison experienced by [[The Sewer Kids|Whistler]] and halted or fixed the shark lycanthropy in [[The Sewer Kids|Cooke]].

As payment, he's requested a moment of everyone's time.
