Summary: Gael, the leader, a fighter who uses a lance. Female kitsune. Lots of jumping, said to be slippery. She escaped from the slums when Juliet and Morgan were arguing with the guards on top of the slum walls. 

She lent one half of a sending coin to Griff. She reported: "Doc listen, something's wrong, there are no cages outside. I got out while your friend was getting shot. Going to guild, how are monsters happening."

Griff responded "Inquisition has archives on lockdown. Inquisitor Chastain can vouch for my party, be safe."
