Saint Elfangor was responsible for preserving the teachings of Henryk. It was her efforts that allowed the teachings to survive the Endless Winter into the modern Age of the Sovereign. She secured the Towers of Forgiveness and laid the groundwork for which the art of sin eating would be perfected. It was through these acts that she found the First Confessor, whom drowned in the sins that had come to nearly consume the land in its entirety. Her rule was ruthless in its mercy. It was this blood iron reign that saw her teach the methods of torture, execution, and sacrifice that would allow all vile sinners to know the heights of euphoria when they at least received their mercy. No humiliation would be unwelcome. No wound would be neglected, and no pain would be forgotten.
