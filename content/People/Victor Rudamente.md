Summary:
Benecio's brother who really doesn't like him. Currently Sway's main suspect for who is killing Mercury's teams. He likely has some kind of monitoring on Benecio's Tower as it was bombed after the reality pearl protecting it was triggered.

He was discovered by finding a job posting that was removed shortly after it was posted. The Sewer Kids were the ones to provide the posting.

After being called Benecio and an evil wizard by Sway, he revealed that all of the Looking Glass Ravens all died and he brought them back with heretical magics. Victor was branded(literally) a heretic and served time in prison. He feels that Benecio killed their mother and the ravens through his creation of the Mist. He warns that if we keep playing with Benecio, well all die. We should just run away. He says that he experimented on Thorne and she is planning on destroying the city. He knows where the chimera are coming from. 

He says, "A smart bomb maker makes two bombs"
