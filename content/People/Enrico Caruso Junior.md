Enrico Caruso Jr., Grand Chancellor of the Senate, The Third Pillar. His father before him served seventeen consecutive terms as Grand Chancellor before his untimely death. Enrico has been accused of nepotism, inappropriate behavior, and of being a puppet Chancellor. Whom he is a puppet of is up to massive debate, but there is a consensus that the Grand Chancellor is doing far better than anyone could expect of a 12 year old. He is guarded by [[Carrol Jupiter]]

His stadium battle birthday was interrupted by an airship carrying [[Esmerelda]] and the party crashing into the stands. He has [[The Arcstone]] that is wanted by the Wastelanders.

At the end of [[the attack on the slums]], he, [[Bazett Sc√°thach Dagda]], and the First pillar, [[Gareth Soders]], emerge from a plane called the Turtleduck. Enrico, "I, the chancellor, am here to announce world peace." He's been engaged to Bazett Dagda.
