Summary: 
The poor fuck that decided to try to kidnap Malakai-as-Sway when they was lost in the Entertainment district. Sway crippled him. He now serves as Sway's warning.

He's alive, but deeply unwell. It was a rush job, so crippling him was the goal. Generally, everything is just less functional. He won't be able to hold a blade again, he walks with a limp, he's missing a toe that Sway has stashed away in case the man gets any silly ideas, half deaf, half blind, the joint of the jaw on one side painful when being used. Nothing was said about the Children of Mercy the entire time. Sway is doing her best not to do anything distinctive, but it's not like she knows what's distinctive. Sway doesn't want to kill him, or to have him lose the will to live. His purpose is to serve a warning.
