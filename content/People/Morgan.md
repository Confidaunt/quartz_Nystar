Grew up on the border of [[The Kingdom of Caderousse]] and raised in a church of [[Farom]]. He's not actually a half elf, but is instead a little blue Tiefling. He has a magical hat of disguise that allows him to change his appearance and size.

He's actually a changeling. He's mentioned his auntie Stab a few times. One of his dads died, and the other didn't show up. The living dad is a member of the church of Farom.

"Once upon a midnight dreary, I see a boy standing near me, looking sullen, weak and weary. Tis but a shame, that he tried to make his name, but it went like his father, up in flames! Not a boy but just a blank sheet of parchment scared of ink, no someones reading it, tear it up in a blink! How have you not realized before that youâ€™re just shreds of paper on the floor. Merely this, Nevermore!"
~ Cerberus
