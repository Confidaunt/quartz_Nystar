Known as Asha to her friends, Sebastia was selected early in life to serve as a handmaid for the 35th Confessor. Her family was a respected pillar of their local community and her energy was high. There was a hope that she could match and contain the rambunctiousness of the 35th Confessor in waiting. It was a good match and they got on like a barn on fire. 

Tany, the personal name that Asha calls the 35th Confessor in private, quickly became the best of friends. They spent the endless days of childhood exploring the little cloister in which the Confessor lived and rarely left. Storytellers were the most often guest aside from church staff. Tany loved stories far more than she did, but she loved acting them out and performing them for the rest of the Confessors entourage and guards. The Iron Shepherds were always scary to her. Asha knew that one of Tany's previous handmaids almost died by their hand. Only Sway's intervention spared the other girls life.

Asha and Tany started playing kissing games when they were 17/18, nothing serious, and it was understood by both of them that nothing could come of it, but it's standard practice to separate anyone too attached to the Confessor, or eventual Confessor. Sebastia woke up with a bag over her head being carried out of her modest quarters. She struggled briefly. A dry voice informed her that her affections towards the Confessor were noted and that she is no longer a Handmaid. She was returned to her family. Asha was reeducated during her time away.

Right after the inheriting, Confessor is having trouble knowing/feeling/processing all the shit and the Church is worried that they might have to harvest the 35th within a month. Asha comforts and coaxes her back to duty. There's still a lot between them, but they aren't kids any more. It was made very clear that while her service was required, her access would be monitored for slip ups.

Asha left the church with Tany to seek adventure. She was worried for Tany, excited to meet savages, and terrified of the Iron Shepherds which would no doubt be following closely behind. This would be her only chance to prevent Tany from completing her final duty as a confessor.

While traveling with a small theatre company, Gaiety(Litany) and Levity(Asha) met tragedy. There was a powerful local who was interested in Gaiety carnally and refused to take any answer but yes. They both tried several methods to shake him, but in the end Levity struck out at him and the pair fled. Levity was hurt by a poisoned weapon as they fled. Levity didn't share this until they were both safely hidden in the woods nearby. Gaiety was frantic. She returned to the town and store medicine. When she got back, Asha was dead and Confessor failed her most basic of purposes. Confessor buried her handmaiden and most beloved friend, but took a vertebrae. It's going to be whichever one is most often represented Maodokanna getting stabbed in. Confessor needs to raise her handmaiden and receive her confession once she gets to the Black Towers. She keeps the bone wrapped in embroidered silk in one of her pouches.

Asha definitely cared for Litany exponentially. She would have gone to the end of the earth for her.

Sebastia's true name:
To lie with you 
in a field of grass 
to lie there forever 
and let time pass 

Touching lightly 
shoulder and thigh 
Neither wanting more 
Neither asking why 

To have your whole 
cool body's length 
along my own 
to know the strength 
of a secret tide 
of longing seep 
into our veins 
go deep...deep 

Dissolving flesh 
and melting bone 
Oh, to lie with you 
alone 

To feel your breast 
rise with my sigh 
To hold you mirrored 
in my eye 

Neither wanting more 
Neither asking why


Last Met: The forest where she died, her ghost in a double reality pearl.
