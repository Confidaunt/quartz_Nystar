Gareth Soders, The High Warden of the Toshkan Empire, the First Pillar. They say that Soders was born frowning. Those whom used to be alive have even said that to his face, and yet he did not smile. Not even a crack. Holding the security of the Empire above all else, the rivalry between Soders and [[Kind Von Der Ritter]] is as infamous as the rivalry between the concept of being alive and being dead. The Wardens of the Empire are said to be the only military force in the world that can rival the military of its own empire.
