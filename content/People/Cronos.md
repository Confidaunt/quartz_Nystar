Summary:
A strange individual. He had two forms, one a very broad chested pure black figure and one a red cloaked figure with webbed hands. He worked for Escobar.

He has some sort of illusionary and portal powers. In the pure black form, he was immune to all damage but psychic and force. If he took damage of that kind, he was knocked out of that shape and became a 'normal' humanoid. 

When complimented on his illusions, he said they weren't illusions. 

He also summoned a giant death toad that the party fought. After it was defeated, the party went up some stairs and Morgan was spooked. Juliet sensed magic, realized the floor wasn't real and the party fell into a kind of nether space that lead further into Mount Megadeath.

Cronos could also cast dispel magic.
