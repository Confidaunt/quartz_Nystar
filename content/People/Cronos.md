A strange individual. He  was a very broad chested pure black figure. He worked for [[Escobar]].

He has some sort of time based powers. He was immune to all damage but psychic and force. If he took damage of that kind, he was then normally vulnerable to all damage. 

When complimented on his illusions, he said they weren't illusions. 

Cronos could also cast dispel magic.
