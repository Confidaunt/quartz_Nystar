Summary: A woman in orange sleeveless robes with canine themed armor. She levitates, reads minds, and recites bad poetry. She confronts Morgan first. He's unable to hit her. She claims she's here for Victor. Sway sneaks a peek and is called "the most recent product of Umbossian capitalism." Sway tells Victor that there's someone here to see him. 

Victor returns and calls her Arthur's replacement. 

"You think that I'm going to go back and work for you fucking people now. I know who. I know who you are. I know who took Arthur's place, I know your in charge. I know your name. Babayaga."

She corrects him "Your so desperate to fight the loom of the weave. Before there was a place called the Nine Hells. But hell could be escaped Victor. You could always come to love the flames. You called me babayaga, right name, wrong person. Not Gawain, who took Arthur's place, I am Ewain. In the nine hells, the entrance was guarded by a three headed beast. I always found the concept of being able to escape hell. Im a big believer in manifest destiny, real agency and realizing prophecy. Behind my eyes, you'll find personal hell. It's not something that you can escape from. It comes from your own actions and purpose. That which you hate most in the world will be what you experience and create."

"Didn't you ever wonder that everything in your mother's life everything failed. No matter what she tried to do, in staying sober, in helping others prosper, why every ward suffered tragedy. Darryl is the one behind all of the tragedy. You raised her from the void, merged her with the beholder and given her so many eyes to look at her. Nothing you ever did would ever save her, ever help her, and she will never escape the hell that she's in. Everything that you've done is for naught."

Dante as himself and Loomis as Benecio appear. 

There had been a deific level of observation. Like watching a play. There's a look of 'oh shit'. When she see Dante transform into a big demonic thing.
