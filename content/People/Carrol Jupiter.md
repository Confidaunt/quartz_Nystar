He's the Captain of [[The Haven Guard]]. Carroll was first encountered by [[The Legendseekers]] after we crashed [[Esmerelda]] airship into the stadium where Chancellor [[Enrico Caruso Junior]] was celebrating his twelfth birthday. He had something to do with our guild being assigned to Mercury.

After the assassination attempt on Queen [[Jessamine Hypatia]], he willingly surrendered to the Haven Guard as it was suspected that [[Mars DeWinter]] may have been behind the attack. His role was temporarily assigned to Captain [[Flynn]].
