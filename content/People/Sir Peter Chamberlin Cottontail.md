Summary: He serves at his Lady [[Bazett Scáthach Dagda]]'s pleasure. He's a spirit possessing a stuffed animal. 

He's said that he's a storyteller in search of more stories.

The party has learned from Benecio that King Dagda, the father of Lady Babette, was one of [[The Knights of the Round Table]], [[Morganna]]. King Dagda was acting erratically before his death. Benecio claims that the other members of the round table knew that he was close to getting Dagda and killed him to prevent it.


"Oh and if it is not the princess’s toy, but you’re not just a toy and she’s not just a princess is she? Otherwise I’d be able to see even further into your minds. Do tell your sweet Princess that I’m terribly sorry for her loss, I do hope they find the culprit soon." ~Cerberus
