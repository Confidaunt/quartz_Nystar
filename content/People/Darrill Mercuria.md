Darrill Mercuria is a washed up adventurer with a [[Darrill Mercury's Old Teams|lethal track record]] of mentoring adventuring guilds. The Legendseekers are her tenth team in twelve years. To the best of our knowledge, she's no longer in contact with previous members of the Looking Glass Ravens, her previous team.

She became an adventurer to pay back the debt that her parents built up that she had inherited, making her a slave. She was married to [[Benecio Plutok Rudamente|Benecio]]'s father and had two children with him, [[Charlie]] and [[Angel]]. She got out of her marriage at 15. The children died. Benecio killed his father. [[Victor Von Rudamente|Victor]] brought [[The Looking Glass Ravens]] back from the void after [[The Zhire Incident]]. He's got some unexplored hang ups about Mercury, as does Benecio.

Victor left her a note reading the night before the Annual Beast Hunt:
"Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Mercy. How we feeling bout my offer for the kiddos eh? Eh? It'll make family reunions whole lot less lonely right? Think bout it. Kiss kiss"

She seems very protective over the Legendseekers. She killed two men who were after a bounty placed on Sway with the Thieves Guild by [[Abraham]]. Darryl knows that Sway is from [[The Holy Dominion of Forgiveness]], but not that she's [[The Confessor]].

The Fire Genasi member of the Platinum Dragons said "But she's dead" when told the Legendseekers were her most recent team.

[[Nystar/People/Cerberus|Cerberus]] claims that she cursed Mercury to drive herself to unconsciously make choices that would lead her to her own personal hell. 

Appearance: 
A bedraggled one eyed, one armed woman.

First Met: 
She was incredibly drunk in the Royal Flush. Sway was suspicious that she didn't remember her name, but Darryl in fact did remember her name. Darryl did cocaine and ran away.

Last Met: 
Juliet saw her leaving the morning of the attack on the queen. She was going to [[Yggdrasil]] to create some cover for Sway.
