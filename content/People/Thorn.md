Summary:
A red haired half elf with an impressive burn scar on her face. She has cerulean and rose theming on her armor. She was first encountered in Mt Megadeath's Treasure Tomb leading a meeting between the Underground and the Wastelanders. She was next seen by Juliet in the Underground Underground Bar rallying Underground recruits in Megido. 

The party next ran across her looking very disheveled and unwell being tortured by Escobar.  She appeared to have been held captive for a number of weeks. This pointed to the version of her seen by Juliet being a duplicate of some sort. 

She said that the party had to warn of an attack on the Chancellor of Megido, Enrico Jr. 

She stayed with the group until the large fight between the dragon armored woman and the platinum dragons. She's not been seen since.

Thorn is known to Lumis. They claim that Thorne is the maker of the bomb that was on Escobar's train. Lumis further claims that she's going to try to attack the city.

Appearance: A red haired half elf with an impressive burn scar on her face. She has cerulean and rose theming on her armor.
