A member of the defunct [[The Looking Glass Ravens]]. The Royal Alchemist for the Chancellor. [[Darrill Mercuria|Darrill]] has called him a 'heartbreaker' and warned Griff to look out for him. He and Darrill have a complicated relationship as she was once a slave, child bride, and wed to his father to his father who he killed at some point. He also has a brother [[Victor Von Rudamente]], and two siblings by Darrill, [[Angel]] and [[Charlie]].

He's actively trying to destroy [[The Knights of the Round Table]]. He's offered [[The Legendseekers]] a bounty for any information we can provide him about the Roundtable. He and the Looking Glass Ravens discovered the interference of the Roundtable and took a stand against it. For their efforts, they were poisoned by Benecio's [[The Mist|Mist]] that was stolen by Roundtable member [[Arthur]], who appeared to die in the aftermath during [[The Zhire Incident]].

Juliet discovered him in an underground meeting observing [[Thorn]]([[Loomis]]). He sees the Underground as pointless and there will be fighting no matter what is done. He has some source of information as he was pretty immediately informed of the attack on the [[Jessamine Hypatia|Queen]]. He's some flavor of queer as discovered by banter with Juliet.

He believes that Knowledge is Power. Knowing what you can't do is more important than knowing what you can do. Learning in the smartest thing that you can do.

Benecio's tower home was bombed by Victor when the actual Thorn went there for purposes unknown. Sway thinks it's likely that [[Double Reality Pearl]] event weakened the tower's defenses.  Benecio's whereabouts are unknown.
