It's entertainment district is almost as legendary as [[Heimdall Station]], where the [[Bifrost Express]] makes port from every corner of the globe. It's three dimensional, clockwork like design, and incredible culture has made it a vacationers hotspot. It is the haven for adventurers, guild masters and thieves alike. Everybody buying here. The only Kingdom not on the continental Toshka, and not within the reach of the Ringed City, it is nevertheless, one of the most well defended places in the World.

A city started at the site of The First Red Dragon, Magiidra. The site of [[Nystar/Places/Continents/Toshka/The Toshkan Empire/Kingdoms/Megido/The Moonlight Archives]], the premier adventuring guild in the Toshkan Empire.
