Also known as the Ringed City. Surrounds the continental Toshka, it's massive walls forming the worlds most venerated defensive structure. Spanning the entire continent, the kingdom is ruled by Lord Kaiser [[Kind Von Der Ritter]]. A central outpost of trade, travel, and military might, it is the impenetrable shield of the Toshkan Empire, long said to be the bane of any would be invader. The walls stand four hundred feet high, with the cities within forming vast vertical networks of commerce and industry. Some born within Aias have never felt the feeling of the sun on their skin.

Theory: Rho Aias is Krimhilda's shield and also one of the Treasures. Maybe a lesser treasure. It sounds like a prismatic wall reskinned.
