The Kingdom of Magic as it is so informally called is ruled by Provost [[Darnic Novikov]]. While dwarfed in size compared to the other Kingdoms, Arcadia acts as the first and last stop in premier education of the royal families and the arcane. Also known as the Kingdom of Universities, and the city of endless colleges, Arcadia is a beautiful benchmark of arcane engineering, ensuring that the finest young minds can be molded into the most brilliant of arcanists. For a price.
