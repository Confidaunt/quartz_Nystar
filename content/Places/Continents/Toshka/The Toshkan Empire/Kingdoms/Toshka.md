The jagged rocky mountains that make up [[Alloy Islands]] of the Eastern front of Toshka have a legendary reputation for their rich ores, difficult terrain, and impregnable nature. [[The East Gate]] of [[Rho Aias]], known as the Iron Gate, is fearsome for it's natural barriers complimenting the Ringed City. The vast mountain ranges that lead to the mainland of Toshka are plentiful in mining communities, while the Alloy islands provide much in the way of plentiful resources in fish. [[Rhymera Onyx, Warden of the East]], has kept the Iron Gate well defended from the capital city of [[Ferries Harbor]]. Not even the most desperate would dare sail into the Alloy Islands, knowing canon fire could come from any of the nearby volcanoes. It is said the only way to get to the City of the Sovereign, [[Balmung]] is through one of the many deep volcanoes that line the region. Only those whom are taken into the Sovereigns direct service, a Pillar, or one who'd dare to swim through lava, would meet her grace, something that has not been done in over 150 years.
