Caderousse was once known as the Sunrise kingdom. No matter where in the world you were, the sun was surely rising on something that Caderousse occupied. But to have more enemies than friends comes at a steep price, one that grows even steeper when the once proud Kingdom accidentally awakened the Black Terror of Fafnir.

The smoke of Fafnir choked out the sun on the Sunrise kingdom, and even when the fowl beast was struck down, it was well and truly night. The rapid rise of the Toshkan empire, the self annexation of LeBeaux Mishigamaw and countless others, led to the Kingdom losing its status as The Gods Favorite Kingdom.

Heavily religious, and slow to evolve, the Kingdom has been in a downward spiral of misrule, tyranny, and long held grudges. Forgiveness from the lands it once dominated is as slow and rare as the day is young. Known derogatorily as the Sunset kingdom, it is become increasingly fascist in its desperate attempts to cling hold to the legacy that now threatens to eclipse it entirely.
