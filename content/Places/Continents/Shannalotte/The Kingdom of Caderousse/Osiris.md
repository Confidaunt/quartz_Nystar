The Summer Court of Osiris; The Diamond of the Desert. The Crown Jewel of Triumph through adversity. Few places are more hostile to live in than Osiris, and yet few have laid greater claim to living life than an Osiran. To live lavishly, is the only true way to live in the Amrun-Kun's favorite Court. There is no fear of the Spring Court, or the land of Fafnir, because no mortal, immortal, dragon, or otherwise has marched through the deserts of Osiris and claimed the Capital of the Court; Gilgamesh. Few have ever dared to try. The Summer Court are lords over all that is golden and bright, and nothing is more caked in gold than the lives of those who live within. To challenge the very idea of it is to celebrate your own ignorance. The lowest slave in Gilgamesh will eat a better meal than Queen Hypatia herself. Bow to Osiris, and all those that live within it, for while Osirans bask in the greatest glow of the Sun God, all others must live in their shade.
