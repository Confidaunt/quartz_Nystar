The Spring Court, said to be founded by River King Vanduo, one of the great heroes of the Convergence and named in his honor, is connected to the continent of Volumetal, and has often shared a luxorious trade route with the Land of Thousand Islands. Vanduos endless rivers and incredible lakes and swamps are second to none, making invasion by land or water a complete folly to anyone dare fool enough to try. The capital of its Court, Amnok, is located in the center of said Great Lake, and is one of the greatest threats to piracy across the Nine Seas. A wealthy and powerful Court of industry and trade, it has bred tension with the other Courts over it's ironclad rule over trade routes, and its deep seated rivalry with Fafnir. Its navy is second only to the Toshkan Empire.
