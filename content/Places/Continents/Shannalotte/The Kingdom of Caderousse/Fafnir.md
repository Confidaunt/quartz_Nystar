What had been taken from Armagh, became great badlands, the Court of Fafnir. A curse was said to be laid on the lands, that any child sired there would grow with the likeness of Fafnir. Tails and horns on otherwise human or elven children, dragonborn from those whom never laid with such. These arid badlands of high winds and magma have forced those to carve out a harsh life. Within cities on acidic lakes, towns on lava pools, and it's massive network of Underdark providing true civilization and protection to all Fafnirans. Long considered outsiders by the Courts, Fafnir has often been considered a place of the lawless, but those whom live there are known to be as hardy and tough as has come. Their capital is [[Nystar/Places/Continents/Shannalotte/The Kingdom of Caderousse/Fafnir/Balmung]], named after Krimhilda's greatest sword. The last great land of the dragons, many have taken to Fafnir with not just pride, but stubbornness. A defiant shout to the heavens, a refusal to die.
