The Winter Court, known now as Chernabog, is land of the forever blizzard. Some claim that it was the icey peaks of Mount Koschei, the Immortal mountain range that has claimed more lives of would be invaders than any army that the Court of Chernabog has ever created was what protected the region from Fafnir's fire. Others claim it was the looming threat of Baba Yaga, or the relentless ballista's of Chernabog's most fearsome warriors. Orcs, dwarves, giants, shifters, goliaths, and oni have long laid claim to the great snowbanks, and have long made it their own, but the looming threat of Her Crystalline Majesty, [[Morrinn Boreas]], from across the [[Great White Expanse of Gletchner]] has led to paranoia and desolation. Her claim for the land has never felt as absolute as it does now, and Chernabogians want nothing more than the right to exist, so often denied, even within the heart of their capital of the Court Marzanna.
