Umbassa, the land of shadows and pain.

Across misty mountains, black lakes, and trees that block out what little sun kisses the ground, you may find yourself in Umbassa. From the southern [[Swamp of Sorrow]], to [[The Great Lake of Serkonas]], to the endless [[Nimrodel Woods]], the land is said to be cursed. Pain has soaked into the soil of this land, which has known death like an ocean knows water.

There is but life there, life such as in [[The Great City of Sakura]], known for its striking trees as it sits high upon the [[Viggoloan Plateau]]. Those whom reside in the Swamp of Sorrow below cannot even see the sun, but it is a blessed day if maybe one, just one Sakura petal drifts down to kiss their bog of disease and filth. They may as well be universes away. Witchcraft, hags, and the undead haunt these lands as passionately as the Rangers who hunt them, but there may be no greater presence felt than that of [[The Church of Mercy]] and it's Children.

Far in the North, east of the [[Sanctuary Kingdom of Benlo]] and the Nimrodel woods, north of The Great Lake of Serkonas, is wherein lies [[The Holy Dominion of Forgiveness]]. Devout followers of [[Maodokanna]], the Children of Mercy, have helped bring [[Nystar/Places/Continents/Umbassa]] back into a shade of its former glory, long forgotten. The ebony towers of [[Forgiveness]] that pierce the thick mist rising high and above. They wish for nothing but the end of suffering for all. And wish to fulfill that with everything in their power. They take in all sinners, are criminals, all outcasts. May the hopeless and the wretched find comfort, for the Children of Mercy shall eat your sin away, and allow you to feel pure. Blood magic, profane displays, and sacrilegious rituals are all rumored, but have rarely been confirmed, but never denied by the Children of Mercy. There is no shame in their land of Umbassa, no bigotry, no hatred. There is only acceptance, of your impure soul.
