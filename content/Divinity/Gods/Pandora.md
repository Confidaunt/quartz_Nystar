The goddess of life and of death and of Friendship. She is depicted as the first grand protector of the Great Loom itself, and the one who spirits those through the Veil once they have crossed the void. The Holy Orders of Pandora have a strict love for life, and appreciation for the consequence of death. Undead are mercilessly hunted down, so as to allow them pilgrimage to the Great Loom. Her Holy Symbol is that of a Monochrome Crown, of which she is often depicted wearing, while her holy weapon is an ultra long sword, more like a large slab of iron than any real blade. Her colors are monochrome.
