The god of all that which has been created. He is the World, the Cosmos, the Time. Said to be a brilliant platinum dragon, whose egg is the very planet those stand on. He is the Father of all dragons, and all dragons, from the lowliest kobold, to the great god of the sun, are under his lineage. His holy symbols are a depiction of the Loom itself, which often takes the appearance of a platinum harp, but also there is depictions of him wielding mighty lances in battle, and those whom follow in the First Church of Nystar are known for their excellent spear work. His Colors are Platinum.
