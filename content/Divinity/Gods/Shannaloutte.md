The goddess of the Feywild. Depicted as a young half dragon woman with red hair and an emerald cloak. Goddess of Courage and of the four seasons, freedom, fey, magic, tranquility, travel, mystery, commerce, duty, and  retribution. Often called the Daughter of all Dragons. Worship of her in a post Fafnir world has been strained, with questioning of her actions a topic that is taboo no longer. Debated as to if she ever truly crossed the Veil or not. Her holy symbol is depicted as the symbol of the Four Courts of the Feywild joined together, and her holy weapon is a powerful magic staff. Her colors are ruby and emerald.
