The goddess of Love, compassion, emotion, connection, language, spirit, depression, happiness, anxiety, relief, sex, and willpower. Frequently depicted as a young adult half elven woman with blue hair, she is the guardian of children and the warden of the sea. Her whispers heard on the air of the night to those needing comfort in their most troubling times. An enemy of Nystar, as her compassion has made her unwilling to abide by the laws of the Veil. This opposition is what led to the Great Conflict between Nystar and Koyukiâ€™s brother, [[Maodokanna]]. Her holy symbol is that of a lighthouse at the sea, and she does not have a recognized holy weapon. Her colors are diamond, aquamarine, and sapphire.
