The god of Light. Of ambition, of ruthlessness, of determination, of elimination, of power. Considered the least understood god of the Primary Gods, his holdings within the Pantheon is supported by the Toshkan Empire by direct order of the Sovereign herself. Very little is understood of him, only that his symbol was worn by the Sovereign in her battle with the great and terrible Fafnir. His colors are that of the Sovereigns, red, black, with his holy symbol being a human eyeball painted red.
