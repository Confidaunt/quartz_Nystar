After Convergence, the great dragon [[Nystar]] weaved the Great Loom of Life into being. To protect it, the Veil was created, separating the afterlife from the mortal world, making a realm for the godlike beings to no longer be able to directly mettle in the affairs of mortals. The distance, between the planet and the Veil is known as the Void, where all those whom fail to find their way past the Veil will fall, damned to lose their name that once held them close to the Great Loom of Life. The Nine Primary Gods are all ruled over by Nystar, while the Sovereign acts as an outlier, recognized by some as a deity, but not all.
